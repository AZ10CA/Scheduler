## Task Scheduler

This project provides a solution for scheduling tasks during the day in a productive manner. The program reads the tasks entered by the user and creates two schedules in text format: one using the greedy approach and the other using a careful brute force approach.

### Task Classification

The tasks entered by the user are classified into two categories:

Strict habits: These tasks must be performed at a specific time during the day. For example, from 3pm to 4pm.
Flexible habits: These habits must be performed for a specific duration within a time interval during the day. For example, exercise for 30 minutes between 3pm and 5pm.
### Scheduling Approach

The program is designed to maximize productivity by fitting as many tasks as possible into the schedule. The greedy approach is used to create the first schedule, while the second schedule is created using a careful brute force approach. The brute force approach has been proven to be a better solution when the greedy approach fails.

### Stream Class

A Stream class has been created for this project, which has several useful features that work similarly to Java's Streams. This class can be used to simplify the code and make it easier to read.

### Important Note

Please note that the program is still in the early stages and there are some edge cases that it cannot handle at the moment. However, development is ongoing, and improvements are being made to address these issues.

### Conclusion

This program provides an efficient solution for scheduling tasks in a productive manner by classifying them into two categories and creating two schedules using different approaches. The Stream class also makes it easier to write and read the code. Despite its current limitations, the project is still a work in progress and is being constantly improved to handle edge cases and provide an even better solution.
